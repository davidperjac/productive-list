## About The Project

![Screen Shot](public/images/light.png)

This is a simple Todo List web application built using React. The application allows users to add and remove tasks, mark tasks as complete, and filter tasks by name. The application has been designed with a clean and intuitive user interface with dark mode included, making it easy for users to manage their tasks.
